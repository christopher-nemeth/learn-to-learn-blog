    <p>Welcome to my learn to learn site! My name is Christopher Nemeth and the following links below will take you to the different techniques I demonstrated for the concept of Learn to Learn. Learn to Learn is a modern set of techniques and guidelines for how developers should structure there time learning new and difficult concepts. The three main concepts to Learn to Learn are:</p>   
    <ol class="about-list">
        <li>1. Set the Stage</li>
        <li>2. Play</li>
        <li>3. Reflect</li>
    </ol>   
    </div>  
</div>
    <p>By setting the stage, you in essence want to clear your pallete for the day by closing out tabs/browsers with distracting websites, mute any unimportant notifcations, set a break timer, and set some short term gaols for what you want ot achieve.</p>
    <p>The idea of play is an excellent method to learn new things by "wrestling" with what you're learning. Try it out. Get your hands dirty. Make mistakes. This will help immensily when trying new things especially new languages.</p>
    <p>Most importanly, you want to take the time to reflect at the end of the day to evaluate how your learning process went, what could be better, and what you took away as a win. Self reflections is not just an important learning skill, but in general a great life skill.</p>
    <p>Lastly, some other great considerations to learnign to learn are setting measureable and achievable goals. This will help you manage the alotted time you have dedicated to learning for the day. Also, supporting your local tech community by attending meetups is a great way to network and keep up to date with emerging and new developments in technology.</p>
